# Digital Human - Creating an AI-Driven Virtual Entity

Welcome to **Digital Human**! This repository is dedicated to building a sophisticated virtual entity that can interact with the real world. We are combining state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) with Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) and other cutting-edge techniques to create a digital human that can simulate real-world interactions.

## Introduction

The Digital Human project is an exploration of what it means to create an artificial intelligence that can engage with people in a natural and human-like manner. Our focus is on creating a virtual entity that can understand, process, and generate natural language while also presenting a visual representation using CGI. The goal is to create a digital human that feels lifelike and capable of meaningful interaction.

## Project Overview

In this project, we combine various technologies and techniques to achieve our objectives:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** To enable advanced natural language understanding and generation.
- **Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI):** To create a visual representation of our digital human.
- **Machine Learning and AI Techniques:** For additional intelligence and adaptability.
- **Integration with Real-World Data:** To allow interaction with real-world contexts and information.

## Features

- Advanced natural language processing capabilities.
- Lifelike visual representation through CGI.
- Ability to interact with real-world data sources.
- Customizable behavior and personality traits.
- Open-source and extensible for community contributions.
